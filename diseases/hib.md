title: Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib)
---

Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) is a bacterial infection of the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, which commonly live in the nose or throat or a person and may not cause any harm. However, the bacteria can travel to other parts of the body, or to people who are more susceptible to the bacteria such as infants, elderly people and those with an immune deficiency condition, potentially causing serious harm. As of 2007, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, estimated Hib disease causes 400,000 deaths of children under 5 annually, and is responsible for 3 million cases of serious illness, most of which occur in low- and middle-income countries. 

Hib infection often leads to a variety of other diseases, including meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia. Vaccination is the most effective public health tool capable of preventing the spread of the disease. Since March 2013, 184 countries, constituting of 95% of the World Health Organizationâ€™s member states and 81% of the children born in 2012, have incorporated the Hib vaccine into their national immunisation programs.
