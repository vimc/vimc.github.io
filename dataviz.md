## [Latest Impact Estimates (model runs from 2019)](https://montagu.vaccineimpact.org/2021/visualisation)
Data visualisation tool accompanying [Toor et al](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67635).
This displays impact estimates by calendar year, birth cohort and by year of vaccination for ten pathogens and 112 
countries. See [Echeverria-Londono et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249378v1) for impact 
methodologies. The results are based on 21 mathematical models (from 18 independent research groups). Coverage estimates 
are based on [WUENIC](https://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tswucoveragedtp3.html) 
release 2019 and projected thereafter.
