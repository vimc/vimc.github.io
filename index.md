<div style="font-size:50px; text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium</div>

VIMC is an international community of modellers providing high-quality estimates of the public health impact of vaccination, to inform and improve decision making.

<b>Announcement (November 2022):</b>

<b>We are delighted to announce the start of a new five-year phase of the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium, ‘VIMC 2.0’. This new phase will run from 2022-2027. [A summary of our plans for this new phase can be found here](/2022-11-14-VIMC-2-0-funding). We will be updating our website in the coming months with more details about VIMC 2.0.</b>

<b>As part of VIMC 2.0, [we are now recruiting modelling groups through a Request for Proposals](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/2022-11-23-rfp/). We will hold a webinar on 6 December and we encouarge all potential applicants to join this.</b> 

The following information relates to the first phase of the Consortium (‘VIMC 1.0’, from 2016-2022).

The Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium coordinates the work of several [research groups](/modellers) modelling the impact of vaccination programmes worldwide.   

The Consortium was established at the end of 2016 for a period of five years, and is coordinated by a [secretariat](/secretariat) based at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/).   

As its core objective, the Consortium aims to deliver a more sustainable, efficient, and transparent approach to generating disease burden and vaccine impact estimates. Furthermore, the Consortium works on aggregating the estimates across a portfolio of twelve vaccine-preventable diseases and further advancing the research agenda in the field of vaccine impact modelling.   

The data generated by the Consortium will support the evaluation of existing vaccination programmes, and inform potential future investments and vaccine scale-up opportunities.   


**Vaccines impact estimates published July 2021**

Our second Consortium-wide vaccine impact estimates were recently published in eLife, as an open access article: ['Lives saved with vaccination for 10 pathogens across 112 countries in a pre-COVID-19 world'.](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67635)

View our interactive [data visualisation tool](https://montagu.vaccineimpact.org/2021/visualisation/) for access to the underlying estimates for 2000-2030.

**Vaccines impact estimates published January 2021**

Our first Consortium-wide vaccine impact estimates were published in the Lancet in January 2021, as an open access article: ['Estimating the health impact of vaccination against ten pathogens in 98 low-income and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2030: a modelling study'.](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32657-X)

An [interactive data visualisation tool](https://montagu.vaccineimpact.org/2020/datavis) gives users access to the underlying estimates for 2000-2019.

A version of the article for a younger audience appears in [Science Journal for Teens](https://sciencejournalforkids.org/articles/how-many-lives-do-vaccines-save/).
