The Consortium has opened a new Request for Proposals (RfP), as it seeks to recruit the following:
-	groups with disease-specific models of vaccine impact for:
    - malaria
    - COVID-19
    - meningitis A / multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MMCV)
    - hepatitis B
-	other cross-cutting groups that will add value to the Consortium, e.g. focusing on
    - operational aspects
    - health economics
    - impact of climate on disease dynamics
    - geospatial aspects

Successful models will be invited to join the Consortium as full members and will receive core-funding of up to USD $73,000 or GBP £60,000 per year.

Applicants must be based in a university or other academic/research institution. Prior modelling experience is essential, and models must already be developed and in use. For some categories, applications are restricted to LMIC-based groups, with priority given to specific countries/regions.
