title: Eight new modelling groups join VIMC
---

We are delighted to welcome eight new core-funded groups to the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium. These groups include modellers from Australia, Benin, Brazil, Kenya, Nigeria, Switzerland, Tunisia, and the UK. 

As shown below, we are joined by six new groups with disease-specific models of vaccine impact for COVID-19, hepatitis B and malaria, as well as two cross-cutting groups. The cross-cutting groups will focus on issues such as geospatial modelling and health economics that are relevant across disease areas. 

This announcement follows our recent [request for proposals](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/2022-11-23-rfp/). Thank you to all who expressed an interest or submitted applications, and to our external expert reviewers. 

As part of VIMC’s goal to work with a more diverse international community of modellers, we hope to collaborate with a broad range of modelling groups, not limited to core-funded groups. To stay abreast of future opportunities, please [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/vaccineimpact).
