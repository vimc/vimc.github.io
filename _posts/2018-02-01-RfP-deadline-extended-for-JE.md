The Consortium is looking for models to estimate the global burden of Japanese encephalitis. The original request for proposals can be found [here]({% post_url 2017-12-19-request-for-proposals-yellow-fever-rubella-Japanese-encephalitis-closing date January 30 %}).

The RfP for yellow fever and rubella models has now been closed. We thank all the interested candidates for their applications.

The new closing date for Japanese encephalitis models is 7 February 2018. The requirements remain the same as for the original RfP.
